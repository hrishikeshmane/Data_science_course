# Data Science Course

This is a collection of my Data Science study material, I studied few years back. This repository is by no means a complete guide to Data Science but a compendium and a revision guide.

## List of topics 
* Jupyter Notebook
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Pandas inbuilt visualization
* Seaborn
* Plotly and Cufflinks
* Choropleth Maps

Aggresive and Bottom-up learners can use this repository as a starting point to get into Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
